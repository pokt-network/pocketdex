# To improve query performance, we strongly suggest adding indexes to any field that you plan to filter or sort by
# Add the `@index` or `@index(unique: true)` annotation after any non-key field
# https://academy.subquery.network/build/graphql.html#indexing-by-non-primary-key-field

# Allowed directives
# export const directives = gql`
#  directive @derivedFrom(field: String!) on FIELD_DEFINITION
#  directive @entity on OBJECT
#  directive @jsonField(indexed: Boolean) on OBJECT
#  directive @index(unique: Boolean) on FIELD_DEFINITION
#  directive @compositeIndexes(fields: [[String]]!) on OBJECT
#  directive @fullText(fields: [String!], language: String) on OBJECT
#  directive @dbType(type: String!) on FIELD_DEFINITION
#`;

### Rules:
# 1. Place enums all together under ### ENUMS section
# 2. Place @jsonField all together under ### JSON FIELDS section
# 2.1 Specify indexed: true|false for @jsonFields
# 3. Place entities (like Block, Account, Relays, etc) under ### ENTITIES section
# 4. Sort properties in the following order:
# 4.1. ID!
# 4.2. Required
# 4.3. Indexed (@index)
# 4.4. Optional (without !)
# 4.5. Relations with @deriveFrom
# 5. Place a minimum comment above the entity to describe it and the relation with poktroll
